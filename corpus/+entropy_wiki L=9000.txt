in statistical mechanics entropy is an extensive property of a thermodynamic system it is closely related to the number of microscopic configurations known as microstates that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system such as its volume pressure and temperature under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable the entropy s displaystyle s is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates multiplied by the boltzmann constant kb formally s k b ln  assuming equiprobable microstates displaystyle skmathrm b ln omega text assuming equiprobable microstates macroscopic systems typically have a very large number of possible microscopic configurations for example the entropy of an ideal gas is proportional to the number of gas molecules n roughly twenty liters of gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure has n avogadro's number at equilibrium each of the en configurations can be regarded as random and equally likely the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases such systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium the state with maximum entropy non-isolated systems may lose entropy provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy increases entropy is a function of the state of the system so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states in the idealization that a process is reversible the entropy does not change while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy because it is determined by the number of random microstates entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system given its macroscopic specification for this reason it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder or randomness of a system or of the lack of information about it the concept of entropy plays a central role in information theory boltzmann's constant and therefore entropy have dimensions of energy divided by temperature which has a unit of joules per kelvin j k in the international system of

originator of the concept of entropy main article history of entropy the french mathematician lazare carnot proposed in his paper fundamental principles of equilibrium and movement that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of moment of activity in other words in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful energy building on this work in lazare's son sadi carnot published reflections on the motive power of fire which posited that in all heat-engines whenever caloric what is now known as heat falls through a temperature difference work or motive power can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body he made the analogy with that of how water falls in a water wheel this was an early insight into the second law of thermodynamics carnot based his views of heat partially on the early th century newtonian hypothesis that both heat and light were types of indestructible forms of matter which are attracted and repelled by other matter and partially on the contemporary views of count rumford who showed that heat could be created by friction as when cannon bores are machined carnot reasoned that if the body of the working substance such as a body of steam is returned to its original state at the end of a complete engine cycle that no change occurs in the condition of the working body the first law of thermodynamics deduced from the heat-friction experiments of james joule in expresses the concept of energy and its conservation in all processes the first law however is unable to quantify the effects of friction and dissipation in the s and s german physicist rudolf clausius objected to the supposition that no change occurs in the working body and gave this change a mathematical interpretation by questioning the nature of the inherent loss of usable heat when work is done eg heat produced by friction clausius described entropy as the transformation-content ie dissipative energy use of a thermodynamic system or working body of chemical species during a change of state this was in contrast to earlier views based on the theories of isaac newton that heat was an indestructible particle that had mass later scientists such as ludwig boltzmann josiah willard gibbs and james clerk maxwell gave entropy a statistical basis in boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of ideal gas particles in which he defined entropy to be proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy henceforth the essential problem in statistical thermodynamics ie according to erwin schrdinger has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy e over n identical systems carathodory linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility in terms of trajectories and integrability definitions and descriptions any method involving the notion of entropy the very existence of which depends on the second law of thermodynamics will doubtless seem to many far-fetched and may repel beginners as obscure and difficult of comprehension willard gibbs graphical methods in the thermodynamics of fluids there are two related definitions of entropy the thermodynamic definition and the statistical mechanics definition historically the classical thermodynamics definition developed first in the classical thermodynamics viewpoint the system is composed of very large numbers of constituents atoms molecules and the state of the system is described by the average thermodynamic properties of those constituents the details of the system's constituents are not directly considered but their behavior is described by macroscopically averaged properties eg temperature pressure entropy heat capacity the early classical definition of the properties of the system assumed equilibrium the classical thermodynamic definition of entropy has more recently been extended into the area of non-equilibrium thermodynamics later the thermodynamic properties including entropy were given an alternative definition in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system modeled at first classically eg newtonian particles constituting a gas and later quantum-mechanically photons phonons spins etc the statistical mechanics description of the behavior of a system is necessary as the definition of the properties of a system using classical thermodynamics become an increasingly unreliable method of predicting the final state of a system that is subject to some process function of state there are many thermodynamic properties that are functions of state this means that at a particular thermodynamic state which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system these properties have a certain value often if two properties of the system are determined then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined for instance a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific volume that is determined by those values as another instance a system composed of a pure substance of a single phase at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined and is thus a particular state and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy the fact that entropy is a function of state is one reason it is useful in the carnot cycle the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle hence the line integral of any state function such as entropy over this reversible cycle is zero reversible process entropy is conserved for a reversible process a reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium while producing the maximum work any process which happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible in these cases energy is lost to heat total entropy increases and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost more specifically total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process for example in the carnot cycle while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy the work output if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state thus the total entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible an irreversible process increases entropy carnot cycle the concept of entropy arose from rudolf clausius's study of the carnot cycle in a carnot cycle heat qh is absorbed isothermally at temperature th from a reservoir and given up isothermally as heat qc to a reservoir at tc according to carnot's principle work can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed qh carnot did not distinguish between qh and qc since he was using the incorrect hypothesis that caloric theory was valid and hence heat was conserved the incorrect assumption that qh and qc were equal when in fact qh is greater than qc through the efforts of clausius and kelvin it is now known that the maximum work that a heat engine can produce is the product of the carnot efficiency and the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir w t h t c t h q h t c t h q h displaystyle wleftfrac th-tcthrightqhleft-frac tcthrightqh     to derive the carnot efficiency which is a number less than one kelvin had to evaluate the ratio of the work output to the heat absorbed during the isothermal expansion with the help of the carnot-clapeyron equation which contained an unknown function known as the carnot function the possibility that the carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature was suggested by joule in a letter to kelvin this allowed kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale it is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir w q h q c displaystyle wqh-qc     since the latter is valid over the entire cycle this gave clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle work and heat would not be equal but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle the state function was called the internal energy and it became the first law of thermodynamics now equating and gives q h t h q c t c displaystyle frac qhth-frac qctc or q h t h q c t c displaystyle frac qhthfrac qctc this implies that there is a function of state which is conserved over a complete cycle of the carnot cycle clausius called this state function entropy one can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results it is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy this makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract akin to how the concept of energy arose clausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by carnot's principle the right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system which would now be converted into an inequality w t c t h q h displaystyle wleft-frac tcthrightqh when the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats we get q h q c t c t h q h displaystyle qh-qcleft-frac tcthrightqh or q c t c t h q h displaystyle qcfrac tcthqh so more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the carnot cycle if we denote the entropies by siqiti for the two states then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy s h s c displaystyle sh-sc or s h s c displaystyle shsc the entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the carnot equation the carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system other cycles such as the otto cycle diesel cycle and brayton cycle can be analyzed from the standpoint of the carnot cycle any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics for very small numbers of particles in the system statistical thermodynamics must be used the efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells require an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics classical thermodynamics main article entropy classical thermodynamics conjugate variables of thermodynamics pressurevolume stressstrain temperatureentropy chemical potentialparticle number the thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early s by rudolf clausius and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an isolated system in thermodynamic equilibrium with its parts clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the carnot cycle heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system known as its absolute temperature this relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle thus it was found to be a function of state specifically a thermodynamic state of the system while clausius based his definition on a reversible process there are also irreversible processes that change entropy following the second law of thermodynamics entropy of an isolated system always increases for irreversible processes the difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may not flow to and from an isolated system but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible nevertheless for both closed and isolated systems and indeed also in open systems irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur according to the clausius equality for a reversible cyclic process q rev t displaystyle oint frac delta qtextrevt this means the line integral l q rev t displaystyle int lfrac delta qtextrevt is path-independent so we can define a state function s called entropy which satisfies d s q rev t displaystyle dsfrac delta qtextrevt clausius coined the name entropy entropie for s in he gives transformational content verwandlungsinhalt as a synonym paralleling his thermal and ergonal content wrme- und werkinhalt as the name of u but preferring the term entropy as a close parallel of energy formed by replacing the root of work by that of transformation to find the entropy difference between any two states of a system the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states since entropy is a state function the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states however the entropy change of the surroundings will be different we can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula to obtain the absolute value of the entropy we need the third law of thermodynamics which states that s at absolute zero for perfect crystals from a macroscopic perspective in classical thermodynamics the entropy is interpreted as a state function of a thermodynamic system that is a property depending only on the current state of the system independent of how that state came to be achieved in any process where the system gives up energy e and its entropy falls by s a quantity at least tr s of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat tr is the temperature of the system's external surroundings otherwise the process cannot go forward in classical thermodynamics the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in thermodynamic equilibrium statistical mechanics the statistical definition was developed by ludwig boltzmann in the s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant number which has since been known as boltzmann's constant in summary the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature the interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty or mixedupness in the phrase of gibbs which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties such as temperature pressure and volume have been taken into account for a given set of macroscopic variables the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates in contrast to the macrostate which characterizes plainly observable average quantities a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule the more such states available to the system with appreciable probability the greater the entropy in statistical mechanics entropy is a measure of the number of ways in which a system may be arranged often taken to be a measure of disorder the higher the entropy the higher the disorder this definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system microstates which could give rise to the observed macroscopic state macrostate of the system the constant of proportionality is the boltzmann constant specifically entropy is a logarithmic measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied s k b i p i log p i displaystyle s-kmathrm b sum ipilog pi or equivalently the expected value of the logarithm of the probability that a microstate will be occupied s k b e i log p i displaystyle s-kmathrm b operatorname e ilog pi where kb is the boltzmann constant equal to  jk the summation is over all the possible microstates of the system and pi is the probability that the system is in the i-th microstate this definition assumes that the basis set of states has been picked so that there is no information on their relative phases in a different basis set the more general expression is s k b tr log displaystyle s-kmathrm b operatorname tr widehat rho logwidehat rho where displaystyle widehat rho is the density matrix tr displaystyle operatorname tr is trace and log displaystyle log is the matrix logarithm this density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates for most practical purposes this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for s can be mathematically derived from it but not vice versa in what has been called the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics or the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable ie pi where is the number of microstates this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium then the previous equation reduces to s k b log displaystyle skmathrm b log omega in thermodynamics such a system is one in which the volume number of molecules and internal energy are fixed the microcanonical ensemble the most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system the equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system this uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model the interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy the qualifier for a given set of macroscopic variables above has deep implications if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables they see different entropies for example if observer a uses the variables u v and w and observer b uses u v w x then by changing x observer b can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer a in other words the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment otherwise one might see decreasing entropy entropy can be defined for any markov processes with reversible dynamics and the detailed balance property in boltzmann's lectures on gas theory he showed that this expression gives a measure of entropy for systems of atoms and molecules in the gas phase thus providing a measure for the entropy of classical thermodynamics entropy of a system a thermodynamic system a temperatureentropy diagram for steam the vertical axis represents uniform temperature and the horizontal axis represents specific entropy each dark line on the graph represents constant pressure and these form a mesh with light gray lines of constant volume dark-blue is liquid water light-blue is liquid-steam mixture and faint-blue is steam grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water entropy arises directly from the carnot cycle it can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature entropy is a fundamental function of state in a thermodynamic system pressure density and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the equilibrium state has higher probability more possible combinations of microstates than any other state as an example for a glass of ice water in air at room temperature the difference in temperature between a warm room the surroundings and cold glass of ice and water the system and not part of the room begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal in other words the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water however as calculated in the example the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased in an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy thus when the universe of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum the entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed thermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved state function that is of great importance in the sciences of physics and chemistry historically the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes permitted by conservation laws occur spontaneously while their time reversals also permitted by conservation laws do not systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy for isolated systems entropy never decreases this fact has several important consequences in science first it prohibits perpetual motion machines and second it implies the arrow of entropy has the same direction as the arrow of time increases in entropy correspond to irreversible changes in a system because some energy is expended as waste heat limiting the amount of work a system can do unlike many other functions of state entropy cannot be directly observed but must be calculated entropy can be calculated for a substance as the standard molar entropy from absolute zero also known as absolute entropy or as a difference in entropy from some other reference state which is defined as zero entropy entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature which has a unit of joules per kelvin jk in the international system of units while these are the same units as heat capacity the two concepts are distinct entropy is not a conserved quantity for example in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases the second law of thermodynamics states that a closed system has entropy which may increase or otherwise remain constant chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds one dictionary definition of entropy is that it is a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work for instance a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine a substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine a special case of entropy increase the entropy of mixing occurs when two or more different substances are mixed if the substances are at the same temperature and pressure there is no net exchange of heat or work the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances at a statistical mechanical level this results due to the change in available volume per particle with mixing second law of thermodynamics main article second law of thermodynamics see also thermodynamic equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics the second law of thermodynamics requires that in general the total entropy of any system can't decrease other than by increasing the entropy of some other system hence in a system isolated from its environment the entropy of that system tends not to decrease it follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work the imposition of order to the colder body secondly it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir or a single expanding reservoir undergoing adiabatic cooling which performs adiabatic work as a result there is no possibility of a perpetual motion system it follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process such as a chemical reaction means that it is energetically more efficient it follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease an air conditioner for example may cool the air in a room thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system the heat expelled from the room the system which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system thus the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics in mechanics the second law in conjunction with the fundamental thermodynamic relation places limits on a system's ability to do useful work the entropy change of a system at temperature t absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat q in a reversible way is given by qt more explicitly an energy tr s is not available to do useful work where tr is the temperature of the coldest accessible reservoir or heat sink external to the system for further discussion see exergy statistical mechanics demonstrates that entropy is governed by probability thus allowing for a decrease in disorder even in an isolated system although this is possible such an event has a small probability of occurring making it unlikely the applicability of a second law of thermodynamics is limited to systems which are near or in equilibrium state at the same time laws governing systems which are far from equilibrium are still debatable one of the guiding principles for such systems is the maximum entropy production principle it claims that non-equilibrium systems evolve such as to maximize its entropy production applications the fundamental thermodynamic relation main article fundamental thermodynamic relation the entropy of a system depends on its internal energy and its external parameters such as its volume in the thermodynamic limit this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy u to changes in the entropy and the external parameters this relation is known as the fundamental thermodynamic relation if external pressure p bears on the volume v as the only external parameter this relation is d u t d s p d v displaystyle dutds-pdv since both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature t implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy pressure and temperature may not exist the fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general independent of the microscopic details of the system important examples are the maxwell relations and the relations between heat capacities entropy in chemical thermodynamics thermodynamic entropy is central in chemical thermodynamics enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy in an isolated system the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes the clausius equation of qrevt s introduces the measurement of entropy change s entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems always from hotter to cooler spontaneously the thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature and the unit joule per kelvin jk in the international system of units si thermodynamic entropy is an extensive property meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system in many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an intensive property independent of the size as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass typically the kilogram unit jkgk alternatively in chemistry it is also referred to one mole of substance in which case it is called the molar entropy with a unit of jmolk thus when one mole of substance at about k is warmed by its surroundings to k the sum of the incremental values of qrevt constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at k entropy change also measures the mixing of substances as a summation of their relative quantities in the final mixture entropy is equally essential in predicting the extent and direction of complex chemical reactions for such applications s must be incorporated in an expression that includes both the system and its surroundings suniverse ssurroundings s system this expression becomes via some steps the gibbs free energy equation for reactants and products in the system g the gibbs free energy change of the system h the enthalpy change t s the entropy change entropy balance equation for open systems during steady-state continuous operation an entropy balance applied to an open system accounts for system entropy changes related to heat flow and mass flow across the system boundary in chemical engineering the principles of thermodynamics are commonly applied to open systems ie those in which heat work and mass flow across the system boundary flows of both heat q displaystyle dot q and work ie w s displaystyle dot ws shaft work and pdvdt pressure-volume work across the system boundaries in general cause changes in the entropy of the system transfer as heat entails entropy transfer q t displaystyle dot qt where t is the absolute thermodynamic temperature of the system at the point of the heat flow if there are mass flows across the system boundaries they also influence the total entropy of the system this account in terms of heat and work is valid only for cases in which the work and heat transfers are by paths physically distinct from the paths of entry and exit of matter from the system to derive a generalized entropy balanced equation we start with the general balance equation for the change in any extensive quantity in a thermodynamic system a quantity that may be either conserved such as energy or non-conserved such as entropy the basic generic balance expression states that ddt ie the rate of change of in the system equals the rate at which enters the system at the boundaries minus the rate at which leaves the system across the system boundaries plus the rate at which is generated within the system for an open thermodynamic system in which heat and work are transferred by paths separate from the paths for transfer of matter using this generic balance equation with respect to the rate

different approaches to entropy beyond that of clausius and boltzmann are valid standard textbook definitions the following is a list of additional definitions of entropy from a collection of textbooks a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature a measure of disorder in the universe or of the availability of the energy in a system to do work a measure of a system's thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work in boltzmann's definition entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states or microstates of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium consistent with the boltzmann definition the second law of thermodynamics needs to be re-worded as such that entropy increases over time though the underlying principle remains the same order and disorder main article entropy order and disorder entropy has often been loosely associated with the amount of order or disorder or of chaos in a thermodynamic system the traditional qualitative description of entropy is that it refers to changes in the status quo of the system and is a measure of molecular disorder and the amount of wasted energy in a dynamical energy transformation from one state or form to another in this direction several recent authors have derived exact entropy formulas to account for and measure disorder and order in atomic and molecular assemblies one of the simpler entropy orderdisorder formulas is that derived in by thermodynamic physicist peter landsberg based on a combination of thermodynamics and information theory arguments he argues that when constraints operate on a system such that it is prevented from entering one or more of its possible or permitted states as contrasted with its forbidden states the measure of the total amount of disorder in the system is given by disorder c d c i displaystyle textdisordercd over ci similarly the total amount of order in the system is given by order c o c i displaystyle textorder-co over ci in which cd is the disorder capacity of the system which is the entropy of the parts contained in the permitted ensemble ci is the information capacity of the system an expression similar to shannon's channel capacity and co is the order capacity of the system energy dispersal main article entropy energy dispersal the concept of entropy can be described qualitatively as a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature similar terms have been in use from early in the history of classical thermodynamics and with the development of statistical thermodynamics and quantum theory entropy changes have been described in terms of the mixing or spreading of the total energy of each constituent of a system over its particular quantized energy levels ambiguities in the terms disorder and chaos which usually have meanings directly opposed to equilibrium contribute to widespread confusion and hamper comprehension of entropy for most students as the second law of thermodynamics shows in an isolated system internal portions at different temperatures tend to adjust to a single uniform temperature and thus produce equilibrium a recently developed educational approach avoids ambiguous terms and describes such spreading out of energy as dispersal which leads to loss of the differentials required for work even though the total energy remains constant in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics compare discussion in next section physical chemist peter atkins for example who previously wrote of dispersal leading to a disordered state now writes that spontaneous changes are always accompanied by a dispersal of energy relating entropy to energy usefulness following on from the above it is possible in a thermal context to regard entropy as an indicator or measure of the effectiveness or usefulness of a particular quantity of energy this is because energy supplied at a high temperature ie with low entropy tends to be more useful than the same amount of energy available at room temperature mixing a hot parcel of a fluid with a cold one produces a parcel of intermediate temperature in which the overall increase in entropy represents a loss which can never be replaced thus the fact that the entropy of the universe is steadily increasing means that its total energy is becoming less useful eventually this will lead to the heat death of the universe entropy and adiabatic accessibility a definition of entropy based entirely on the relation of adiabatic accessibility between equilibrium states was given by ehlieb and j yngvason in this approach has several predecessors including the pioneering work of constantin carathodory from and the monograph by r giles in the setting of lieb and yngvason one starts by picking for a unit amount of the substance under consideration two reference states x displaystyle x and x displaystyle x such that the latter is adiabatically accessible from the former but not vice versa defining the entropies of the reference states to be and respectively the entropy of a state x displaystyle x is defined as the largest number displaystyle lambda such that x displaystyle x is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount displaystyle lambda in the state x displaystyle x and a complementary amount displaystyle in the state x displaystyle x a simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element by the following properties it is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility additive on composite systems and extensive under scaling entropy in quantum mechanics main article von neumann entropy in quantum statistical mechanics the concept of entropy was developed by john von neumann and is generally referred to as von neumann entropy s k b tr log displaystyle s-kmathrm b operatorname tr rho log rho where is the density matrix and tr is the trace operator this upholds the correspondence principle because in the classical limit when the phases between the basis states used for the classical probabilities are purely random this expression is equivalent to the familiar classical definition of entropy s k b i p i log p i displaystyle s-kmathrm b sum ipilog pi ie in such a basis the density matrix is diagonal von neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics with his work mathematische grundlagen der quantenmechanik he provided in this work a theory of measurement where the usual notion of wave function collapse is described as an irreversible process the so-called von neumann or projective measurement using this concept in conjunction with the density matrix he extended the classical concept of entropy into the quantum domain information theory i thought of calling it information but the word was overly used so i decided to call it uncertainty von neumann told me you should call it entropy for two reasons in the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name so it already has a name in the second place and more important nobody knows what entropy really is so in a debate you will always have the advantage conversation between claude shannon and john von neumann regarding what name to give to the attenuation in phone-line signals main articles entropy information theory entropy in thermodynamics and information theory and entropic uncertainty when viewed in terms of information theory the entropy state function is simply the amount of information in the shannon sense that would be needed to specify the full microstate of the system this is left unspecified by the macroscopic description in information theory entropy is the measure of the amount of information that is missing before reception and is sometimes referred to as shannon entropy shannon entropy is a broad and general concept which finds applications in information theory as well as thermodynamics it was originally devised by claude shannon in to study the amount of information in a transmitted message the definition of the information entropy is however quite general and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities pi so that h x i n p x i log p x i displaystyle hx-sum inpxilog pxi in the case of transmitted messages these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average amount of information in a message for the case of equal probabilities ie each message is equally probable the shannon entropy in bits is just the number of yesno questions needed to determine the content of the message the question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic while most authors argue that there is a link between the two a few argue that they have nothing to do with each other the expressions for the two entropies are similar if w is the number of microstates that can yield a given macrostate and each microstate has the same a priori probability then that probability is p w the shannon entropy in nats is h i w p log p log w displaystyle h-sum iwplogplogw and if entropy is measured in units of k per nat then the entropy is given by h k log w displaystyle hklogw which is the famous boltzmann entropy formula when k is boltzmann's constant which may be interpreted as the thermodynamic entropy per nat there are many ways of demonstrating the equivalence of information entropy and physics entropy that is the equivalence of shannon entropy and boltzmann entropy nevertheless some authors argue for dropping the word entropy for the h function of information theory and using shannon's other term uncertainty instead experimental measurement of entropy entropy of a substance can be measured although in an indirect way the measurement uses the definition of temperature in terms of entropy while limiting energy exchange to heat d u d q displaystyle durightarrow dq t u s v n d s d q t displaystyle tleftfrac partial upartial srightvnrightarrow cdots rightarrow dsdqt the resulting relation describes how entropy changes d s displaystyle ds when a small amount of energy d q displaystyle dq is introduced into the system at a certain temperature  t displaystyle t the process of measurement goes as follows first a sample of the substance is cooled as close to absolute zero as possible at such temperatures the entropy approaches zerodue to the definition of temperature then small amounts of heat are introduced into the sample and the change in temperature is recorded until the temperature reaches a desired value usually c the obtained data allows the user to integrate the equation above yielding the absolute value of entropy of the substance at the final temperature this value of entropy is called calorimetric entropy interdisciplinary applications of entropy although the concept of entropy was originally a thermodynamic construct it has been adapted in other fields of study including information theory psychodynamics thermoeconomicsecological economics and evolution for instance an entropic argument has been recently proposed for explaining the preference of cave spiders in choosing a suitable area for laying their eggs thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts entropy unit a non-si unit of thermodynamic entropy usually denoted eu and equal to one calorie per kelvin per mole or joules per kelvin per mole gibbs entropy the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system boltzmann entropy a type of gibbs entropy which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution tsallis entropy a generalization of the standard boltzmanngibbs entropy standard molar entropy is the entropy content of one mole of substance under conditions of standard temperature and pressure residual entropy the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to absolute zero entropy of mixing the change in the entropy when two different chemical substances or components are mixed loop entropy is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance conformational entropy is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a polymer chain that assumes a compact or globular state in solution entropic force a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes molecular frictional considerations and statistical variations free entropy an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy entropic explosion an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat entropy change a change in entropy ds between two equilibrium states is given by the heat transferred dqrev divided by the absolute temperature t of the system in this interval sackurtetrode entropy the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations the arrow of time main article entropy arrow of time entropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress sometimes called an arrow of time as time progresses the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time hence from this perspective entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions cosmology main article heat death of the universe since a finite universe is an isolated system the second law of thermodynamics states that its total entropy is continually increasing it has been speculated since the th century that the universe is fated to a heat death in which all the energy ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source if the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy then as roger penrose has pointed out gravity plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars which collapse eventually into black holes the entropy of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the black hole's event horizon jacob bekenstein and stephen hawking have shown that black holes have the maximum possible entropy of any object of equal size this makes them likely end points of all entropy-increasing processes if they are totally effective matter and energy trapscitation needed however the escape of energy from black holes might be possible due to quantum activity see hawking radiation the role of entropy in cosmology remains a controversial subject since the time of ludwig boltzmann recent work has cast some doubt on the heat death hypothesis and the applicability of any simple thermodynamic model to the universe in general although entropy does increase in the model of an expanding universe the maximum possible entropy rises much more rapidly moving the universe further from the heat death with time not closer this results in an entropy gap pushing the system further away from the posited heat death equilibrium other complicating factors such as the energy density of the vacuum and macroscopic quantum effects are difficult to reconcile with thermodynamical models making any predictions of large-scale thermodynamics extremely difficult current theories suggest the entropy gap to have been originally opened up by the early rapid exponential expansion of the universe economics see also nicholas georgescu-roegen  the relevance of thermodynamics to economics and ecological economics  methodology romanian american economist nicholas georgescu-roegen a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics made extensive use of the entropy concept in his magnum opus on the entropy law and the economic process due to georgescu-roegen's work the laws of thermodynamics now form an integral part of the ecological economics schoolf although his work was blemished somewhat by mistakes a full chapter on the economics of georgescu-roegen has approvingly been included in one elementary physics textbook on the historical development of thermodynamics in economics georgescu-roegen's work has generated the term pessimism' since the s leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist herman daly a student of georgescu-roegen has been the economics profession's most influential proponent of the entropy pessimism positionf
